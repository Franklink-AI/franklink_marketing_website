            <!-- Section 1: Manifesto -->
            <section id="manifesto" class="story-section">
                <div class="story-section-inner">
                    <h2 class="story-section-title">The First AI Native Professional Network</h2>
                    <p class="story-lead">Every generation builds the network it needs.</p>
                    <p>In the 1950s, your network was a Rolodex, a stack of cards you flipped through by hand. Who you knew depended on who you had already met. Introductions happened at golf courses, dinner tables, or a hallway you happened to walk through. The friction was huge, and opportunity stayed locked inside small circles.</p>
                    <p>Then came Facebook. For the first time, people could maintain relationships at scale. High school friends, college roommates, distant cousins, all lived in one feed. Social networking proved that digital connections could feel real. But Facebook was built for keeping up with people you already knew, not for finding the people you needed to meet.</p>
                    <p>LinkedIn tried to close that gap. Suddenly, you could search for anyone: a Stanford grad in Singapore, a founder in Sao Paulo, an engineer in Berlin. The internet made everyone visible - but visibility is not connection. <strong>Profile is not context</strong>. A connection request from a stranger is mostly noise. LinkedIn solved discovery. It never solved understanding.</p>
                    <p>Now we are entering a new era. AI can finally do what search engines never could: <strong>understand who you actually are</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Not just your title, but your ambitions, your skills, what you are building, and what keeps you up at night. Frank connects to your email, your calendar, your documents, your conversations. It sees the full picture: the VC meeting you just had, the deadline you are racing toward, the skill gap you want to close, the career pivot you are quietly considering. <strong>This is not surveillance. It is context.</strong> The same context a great mentor or well-connected friend would have if they were paying attention to every detail of your life.</p>
                    <p>With that context, Frank can do what no platform has done before: <strong>make introductions that actually make sense</strong>.</p>
                    <p>He can read between the lines: the founder stuck on go-to-market should meet the growth lead who just solved the same problem. He understands timing: when you are ready for advice, when you need a co-founder, when you are simply looking to learn. Introductions stop being spray-and-pray and become precision plus timing.</p>
                    <p>This is the leap: from searchable to understandable, from profiles to context, from "Who do you know?" to "Who should you know?"</p>
                    <p>Franklink is the professional network rebuilt for this moment. No feed to scroll. No posts to perform. No algorithm optimizing for engagement. Just an AI that knows your story, goals, challenges, and trajectory, and introduces you to the exact people who can help you move forward.</p>
                    <p>The best connections have always come from people who truly know you making introductions on your behalf. Frank is that person - at scale.</p>

                        <li>He turns your schedule, communication, and project progress into a single through line: what you are doing, why, and what you need next.</li>
                        <li>He shifts introductions from random networking to context-aware connections: you do not need to explain yourself from scratch, and people can understand you faster.</li>
                        <li>He feels more like a friend than a platform: less noise, more "just right".</li>

                            <p>We questioned the product's positioning. We asked ourselves: is this what people actually need? Are we solving a real pain or just entertaining ourselves? Each doubt was real, and each time we came back to the same answer — <strong>we want to serve people and make social AI actually help</strong>.</p>

                            <p>We brought a rough version to a hackathon. The response surprised us: people got it fast, tried it often, and said "I need this." That confirmed the direction; now we just need to build faster, steadier, and better.</p>
