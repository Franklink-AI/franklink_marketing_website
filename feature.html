            <div class="about-section-header">
                <h2>Why we built Franklink</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="origin-story-content">
                <p>College students today don't have a shortage of tools. They have Handshake, LinkedIn, job boards, event calendars, email lists, and endless advice threads. What they're missing is something more human: a steady companion that sits beside them through the late-night scrolling, the awkward networking events, and the silent wait for interview results.</p>
                <p>Franklink started with a simple observation: most students don't get stuck because they lack information. They get stuck because they're overwhelmed, unsure what to do next, or too anxious to even start. The hardest part isn't clicking "submit"—it's deciding <em>what</em> to submit, <em>when</em>, and <em>why</em>.</p>
                <p>We built Franklink to feel less like another dashboard and more like a trusted friend who happens to know the career world inside out. It lives where you already talk to the people you trust most—inside iMessage—and it shows up exactly when you need it, not just when you remember to log in.</p>

                    <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
                    <p class="section-intro">Behind every feature in Franklink are a few simple beliefs about what students really need.</p>

                        <p>Most tools wait for you to type a question into a search bar. Franklink watches the shape of your week—your events, deadlines, and inbox—and steps in before you hit the panic point.</p>

                        <h3>Companion, not just a tool</h3>
                        <p>Careers are emotional. Rejections, self-doubt, comparison—they all live right beside your calendar. Franklink is designed to answer both "What do I do?" and "How do I get through this?"</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="philosophy-card fade-in-element">

                        <p>From undecided first-year to invited-back alumni speaker, your path isn't a one-time decision. Franklink stays with you across exploration, action, setbacks, and wins—learning with you the entire way.</p>

                <h2>What makes Franklink different</h2>
                <p class="section-intro">More than search. More than reminders. An anticipatory career companion that stays one step ahead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="diff-grid">
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Anticipatory guidance</h3>
                    <p>Franklink pays attention to your context—your major, interests, events you've attended, and even how you felt about them. Instead of asking, "What are you looking for?", it suggests relevant opportunities, resources, and next steps before you'd think to search.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Exploration that actually narrows the noise</h3>
                    <p>Early on, Franklink nudges you toward a variety of events, clubs, and workshops. After each one, it asks for quick, low-friction feedback in chat and uses that to get more specific. Over time, your feed shifts from "everything happening on campus" to "this feels like it was designed for me."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Auto-apply and prep, right in chat</h3>
                    <p>When Franklink spots a fit—a fellowship, internship, or program—it can pre-fill your information, remind you of the deadline, and ask if you'd like it to submit on your behalf. It then helps you prepare: mock interviews, tailored talking points, and follow-up messages, all without leaving iMessage.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Inbox- and calendar-aware</h3>
                    <p>Franklink connects with your email and calendar (with your permission) to track interview results, coffee chats, and deadlines. It knows when decisions are likely to land, when follow-ups are due, and when your future self will thank you for a gentle reminder.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Emotional support built in</h3>
                    <p>A string of rejections, a ghosted coffee chat, a relationship that didn't work out—these moments can derail momentum. Franklink notices the hard days and responds with empathy, perspective, and small next steps, not generic advice.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diff-card fade-in-element">
                    <h3>Native to how you already live</h3>
                    <p>There's no new portal to remember, no app to dig for. Franklink is an iMessage contact. You text it like you'd text a close friend, and it quietly handles the heavy lifting in the background.</p>

                            <p>One evening, you refresh your inbox and see a wall of "Thank you for your application" emails. On your tracking sheet, the rejection column fills in faster than you'd like to admit. Before you can put words to how it feels, Franklink asks:</p>
                            <div class="story-chat">"Hey, how did everything go today?"</div>
                            <p style="margin-top: var(--space-sm);">When you answer honestly, it doesn't pretend everything is fine. It acknowledges the loss, reminds you how far you've already come, and suggests one small next step. Moments later, a new subject line appears: "Congratulations…" Franklink is right there for that moment too.</p>

                <p>We imagine a world where every student, no matter their background or network, has an always-on career companion in their pocket. Not a noisy feed. Not a one-size-fits-all checklist. A quiet presence that knows when to nudge, when to listen, and when to help you say "yes" to the right next step.</p>
                <p>If career tools have mostly focused on information and access, Franklink is our attempt to add something that's been missing: care, continuity, and a sense that you don't have to figure it all out alone.</p>
