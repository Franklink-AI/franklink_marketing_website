## Section 1: Connect People
**Marketing Copy:**
*   **Title:** Network without the awkwardness.
*   **Body:** Finding the right people is hard. Reaching out is harder. Franklink identifies the alumni and peers who can actually help you, then drafts the perfect opening message to get the conversation started.

**Demo 1: Find People**
*   **User:** "Who are some recent alums working in AI ethics? I want to ask about their day-to-day."
*   **Bot:** "I found 3 alumni who match that description and were active in the Philosophy Club like you:
    1.  **Sarah Chen '23** (Anthropic)
    2.  **David Miller '22** (OpenAI)
    3.  **Priya Gupta '24** (Hugging Face)
    
    Want to connect with one of them?"

**Demo 2: Cold Email**
*   **User:** "Yeah, Sarah looks great. Can you help me write a cold email to her?"
*   **Bot:** "Drafting now. Here's a warm approach mentioning your shared club:

    *Subject: Penn Philosophy Club / Question about AI Ethics*

    *Hi Sarah,*
    
    *I'm a current junior at Penn and also part of the Philosophy Club. I've been following your work at Anthropic and would love to hear your perspective on transitioning from humanities to technical AI safety...*
    
    Ready to send?"

## Section 3: Calendar & Time Management
**Marketing Copy:**
*   **Title:** A calendar that manages itself.

**Demo 5: Add to Calendar**
*   **User:** "I have a midterm for CIS 160 next Thursday at 10 AM."
*   **Bot:** "Got it. I've added the midterm to your calendar.
    
    I also blocked out two 2-hour study sessions for you on Monday and Tuesday evening. Does that work, or should I move them?"

**Demo 6: Reminders**
*   **User:** "Remind me to submit my resume for the career fair tomorrow morning."
*   **Bot:** "Will do. I'll nudge you at 9 AM tomorrow.

**Demo 7: Detailed Plan**
*   **User:** "I want to get into Product Management, but I have no experience. What should I do this summer?"
*   **Bot:** "It's not too late. Here is a 3-step plan for this summer:
    1.  **Build a side project:** We can brainstorm ideas this weekend.
    2.  **Get a certificate:** The Google PM certificate is a good start.
    3.  **Network:** Connect with 5 PM alums (I can find them for you).
    
    Which one do you want to start with?"

**Demo 8: Long-term Memory**
*   **User:** "I'm updating my resume. What did I actually accomplish last semester?"

    *   Built that React app for your final project.
    *   Volunteered at the local shelter every Saturday.
    
    I can bullet-point these for your resume if you like."

## Section 5: Emotional Support
**Marketing Copy:**
*   **Title:** Support when things get tough.
*   **Body:** The career journey isn't a straight line. Franklink is there for the rejections, the stress, and the moments you just need to vent, offering perspective and encouragement.

**Demo 9: Offer Rejection**
*   **User:** "I didn't get the internship at Google. I feel like a failure."
*   **Bot:** "I'm really sorry to hear that. It sucks, and it's okay to be upset.
    
    Remember: this one 'no' doesn't erase your skills or your worth. You still have 3 other active applications, and your portfolio is strong. Take tonight off, and we can look at next steps tomorrow."

**Demo 10: Venting**
*   **User:** "I am so overwhelmed. Everyone else seems to have it figured out."
*   **Bot:** "I promise you, they don't. They're just posting the highlights.
    
    You're doing the work, and that's what matters. Take a deep breath. Is there one small thing we can get off your plate right now to make tonight easier?"
